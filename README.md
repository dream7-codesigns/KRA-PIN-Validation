A simple PHP-based system for registering and validating Kenya KRA PIN records. 
The application uses a lightweight text file (kra_data.txt) for data storage, allowing it to run easily on any PHP environment without requiring a database. 
It supports KRA PIN registration with full validation, ensuring the PIN starts with A or P, follows the correct format, and is not duplicated. 
The system also validates both the name and email before saving, providing a reliable and straightforward way to manage KRA PIN entries.
